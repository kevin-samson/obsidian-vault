## Chicago Convention (1944)

* Led to the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)[cite: 3].
* Deals with the freedoms of the air[cite: 3].
* Not all countries agreed to all five freedoms[cite: 3].
* Applies *only* to civilian aircraft[cite: 4].
* Does *not* apply to:
    * State aircraft (e.g., Air Force One) [cite: 4]
    * Surveillance and spy aircraft [cite: 4]
    * Unmanned aircraft (drones) [cite: 4]

## UNCLOS (1984) and Airspace

* UNCLOS says international airspace starts beyond 12 nautical miles from a country's baseline[cite: 4].
* Littoral states have limited sovereignty over the water of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), but *no* sovereignty over the airspace above it[cite: 4, 5].
* Some countries (e.g., Brazil) argued airspace over the EEZ should be national airspace (they went to ICAO)[cite: 6].
    * They wanted more control over military aircraft in the EEZ[cite: 6].
    * ICAO rejected this, saying freedom of overflight over the high seas and EEZ remains[cite: 6].
* Many countries still contest this, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador[cite: 7].
* Brazil claims UNCLOS doesn't allow military exercises in the EEZ without the coastal state's consent[cite: 8].
* The US, while not ratifying UNCLOS, asserts coastal state jurisdiction over resources in the sea[cite: 9].
* But the US says military exercises in the EEZ are lawful[cite: 10].
* US/Libya: US challenged Libya's claim over the Gulf of Sidra[cite: 11, 12, 13].
* US/China: A US and Chinese aircraft collided over the South China Sea in 2001[cite: 13, 14]. China now claims reconnaissance flights over its EEZ threaten its security[cite: 14].

## Origin of Airspace Law

* Evolved in 3 stages:
    1.  Paris Convention (1919) [cite: 15]
    2.  Chicago Convention (1944) [cite: 15]
    3.  UNCLOS (1984) [cite: 15]

## Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)

* US first declared an ADIZ after the Korean War (1951)[cite: 15].
* US ADIZ extends 250-400 NM off the coast[cite: 15].
* Aircraft entering the US ADIZ must file a flight plan[cite: 15].
* Purpose: identify aircraft before they enter US airspace[cite: 16].
* Other countries (Canada, Japan, South Korea) also established ADIZs[cite: 17].
* China established an ADIZ in 2013[cite: 18].
    * China cites "international practices" but uses internal aviation laws[cite: 18].
    * China's ADIZ aims to assert sovereignty over Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands[cite: 18].
    * China requires aircraft in its ADIZ to follow its instructions[cite: 19].
    * China says it will take "defensive emergency measures" against uncooperative aircraft[cite: 20].
    * US and Japan challenged China's ADIZ with military flights but asked civilian aircraft to comply[cite: 21, 22].
    * Experts warn of potential conflict from miscalculation[cite: 22].
    * There are growing calls for international law to address ADIZ[cite: 23].

## Earlier Conventions

* **Paris Convention (1919):**
    * Based on "Caelum Liberum" (freedom of the sky)[cite: 24].
    * Airspace over the sea is free (like the sea itself)[cite: 24, 25].
    * At that time, the sea was divided into Territorial Water and the High Sea[cite: 25].
* **Chicago Convention (1944):**
    * Combined laws of territorial airspace and airspace over the sea[cite: 25, 26].
    * Countries agreed to respect each other's sovereignty[cite: 26].
    * Military aircraft need permission to fly over another country's territory[cite: 26].

## ICAO's Five Freedoms of the Air

1.  Freedom of peaceful transit[cite: 27].
2.  Freedom to stop for non-traffic reasons (refuel, repair)[cite: 28].
3.  Freedom to carry traffic from the home country to any other country[cite: 28, 29].
4.  Freedom to bring traffic from any other country to the home country[cite: 29].
5.  Freedom to pick up and drop off traffic in other countries[cite: 29, 30].

* Freedom of peaceful transit requires state consent[cite: 30].
