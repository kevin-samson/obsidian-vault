* The competition between European state for Africa also known as the scramble for Africa threatened to result in war. [cite: 1, 2]

    * 1\. Jus ad bellum (when it is legal to go to War) [cite: 7]

    * 1\. L.N expected all members to “respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of states against external aggressions.” [cite: 11]
    * 2\. Reduce armament to “the extent compatible with their own security and international obligations.” [cite: 12]
    * 3\. Submit a dispute for arbitration or judicial settlement. (meaning do not use force as a first resort). [cite: 13]

##   Background

* International Law is study of the interactions between states over time. (Example: ambassadors, Doot) [cite: 14, 15]
* The history of international Law is a history of events, doctrines, states practices and theories about law. (Example: restricted sale of Tobacco) [cite: 15, 16]
* It is also a history of ideas, the attempts of scholars and jurists over the centuries to present the coherent accounts on how state behaves and how international laws is made. [cite: 16, 17]
* How international law evolved When the international community/state needed the law? [cite: 17, 18]

##   Peace of Westphalia (1648)

* Treaty of Westphalia was signed after the Thirty Years War. But why did the war break out? [cite: 18, 19]
* The relationship between the Church and the feudal states during the medieval period went through a number of developments. [cite: 19, 20]
* The struggles for power between kings and Popes shaped the western world. [cite: 20, 21]
* Some states sided with the Church, and others not. Treaty Of Westphalia: Sovereignty of States was established [cite: 21]

##   Role of Jurists: Hugo Grotius

* Hugo Grotius (The Rights of War and Peace, 1625) argued: the great principles of law- whether in relations to war, commerce, or the formation of treaties could be derived from nature or reason rather than God. [cite: 21, 22]
* His major achievement lay in shifting the basis of law from religion to natural law or law based on reason. [cite: 22, 23]
* According to Grotius one of the fundamental principles of this natural law should be Pacta Sunt Servenda (Treaties must be obeyed). [cite: 23, 24]
* Pacta Sunt Servenda –still regarded as a foundation of modern international law. [cite: 24]

##   Now what was Treaty of Westphalia?

* 30 yrs war ended with a peace settlement: It sought to prevent further religious conflict [cite: 25]
    * A) Each Sovereign state has absolute power within its territory and therefore could adopt whatever religion and political system it thought fit [cite: 25]
    * B) No state was justified in attacking another state simply because that other state had a different ideology or religion. [cite: 25, 26]
* It also included a provision that required states to protect the rights of the minorities within their territories. [cite: 26, 27]
* Emergence of Sovereign state or Nation State (Elaborate) [cite: 27]
* Only sovereign entities have full standing in the international system- to bring claims to make international law, and to create international institutions. [cite: 27, 28]
* The Peace of Westphalia can be seen as the beginning of a historical process by which the state became more consolidated. [cite: 28, 29]
* It has its own rationality that was independent of religious consideration and ethics. [cite: 29]
