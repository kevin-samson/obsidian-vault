##   I. Basics of the Law of Treaties

* **Why Study It?** It's a fundamental part of international law, governing how countries interact. [cite: 10]
* **Key Document:** The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) of 1969 is the main source of rules. [cite: 10]
    * Adopted by the UN Conference on the Law of Treaties in May 1969. [cite: 10]
    * Entered into force in January 1980. [cite: 10]
    * [https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1\_1\_1969.pdf](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf) [cite: 10]
* Prepared by International Law Commission [cite: 11]

##   II. Treaty Formation

* **Consent is Key:** A state *must* consent to be legally bound by a treaty. [cite: 11] Consent obtained under pressure is not valid. [cite: 11]
* **Pacta Sunt Servanda:** Once a state consents, it *must* follow the treaty in good faith. [cite: 12, 13]
    * This principle is reflected in article 26 of the VCLT. [cite: 13]
    * A treaty in force ‘is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.’ [cite: 13]
* **How to Consent (VCLT Article 11):** [cite: 13]
    * **Signature:** There is a widespread practice of simply expressing consent by signature [cite: 14]
    * **Accession:** Joining a treaty that other states already negotiated. [cite: 14]
        * Article 15 of the VCLT also permits consent by accession, where a state consents to be bound by a treaty already signed and negotiated by other states. [cite: 14]
        * (Example ??? RAK joining UAE) [cite: 14] [https://treaties.unoda.org/t/tpnw](https://treaties.unoda.org/t/tpnw) [cite: 14]
    * **Ratification:** A state takes time to get approval (e.g., from its parliament) before officially consenting. [cite: 14, 15]
        * Example: Case of Japan (NPT) [cite: 15]
            * Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) [cite: 15]
            * Signature (London) 03 February 1970 [cite: 15]
            * Deposit of instruments of ratification (London) 08 June 1976 [cite: 15]

##   III. Challenging a Treaty's Validity

* **Invalidity:** Since Treaty is based on Consent, it can be withdrawn claiming Invalidity (article 46). [cite: 15] A State can seek invalidation of treaty in the cases: [cite: 15]
    * **Coercion/Force:** If the other party has been coerced to sign the treaty (for example State A seeks consent from B by threatening use of force/ invasion etc.) [cite: 1, 15]
        * The VLCT (article 51 and 52) has kept room open to Invalidate the Treaty in case it is imposed on the other party [cite: 1]
        * No such case in the Post WWII. [cite: 1]
        * What about Versailles Treaty 1919? Germany was coerced to give its consent to join the Versailles Treaty. [cite: 2]
    * **Corruption/Bribery:** In case it has been found that the Consent of a State representative has been sought through corrupt means (for example, by bribing the authority who has been authorized by the state to negotiate/sign etc) The treaty can be terminated. [cite: 3]
        * [https://thewire.in/diplomacy/india-seychelles-sign-revised-pact-assumption-island-allay-local-fears](https://thewire.in/diplomacy/india-seychelles-sign-revised-pact-assumption-island-allay-local-fears) [cite: 4]
    * **Jus Cogens Violation:** If it goes against the pre-emptory norms [cite: 15]
        * a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted [cite: 4]
        * Examples: Child marriage, slave trade, slavery, forced prostitution, torture during detention and custody, war of aggression etc A treaty (signed between/ among the countries directly indirectly violating these norms will become INVALID. [cite: 4, 5]

##   IV. Reservations

* **What are they?** Generally applies to multilateral treaties. [cite: 5] A state can Sign the Treaty with Reservation For example: agrees on Clause 1, 2, 3,5 but does not agree with 4. The state is not bound to abide by Clause 4 of the Treaty [cite: 5]
* **Why allow them?** But why do the IOs, multilateral Treaties allow Reservation? [cite: 5]
* **Examples of Reservations:**
    * USA Reservation: UN Convention on the Right of Child (1989) disagreed the legal definition of the Child “For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.” United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Full text - Children’s Commissioner for Wales (childcomwales.org.uk) [cite: 5]
    * Some Muslim country’s Reservation: UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination (1979) *Matters related to inheritance Obligations are incompatible with Islamic doctrine and practices [cite: 5]

##   V. Termination/Withdrawal

* **Termination:** Termination can be voluntary When objectives are met [cite: 6]
    * NATO?? [cite: 6]
    * USSR Collapsed, Free world Triumphed over Communism NAM: should it continue and be dissolved? [cite: 7]
* **Termination Clauses:** Almost all the Treaties have termination clause [cite: 8]
    * Ex: US-Japan security Treaty ARTICLE X This Treaty shall remain in force until in the opinion of the Governments of Japan and the United States of America there shall have come into force such United Nations arrangements as will satisfactorily provide for the maintenance of international peace and security in the Japan area. [cite: 8, 9]
    * However, after the Treaty has been in force for ten years, either Party may give notice to the other Party of its intention to terminate the Treaty, in which case the Treaty shall terminate one year after such notice has been given. [cite: 9]
* **Withdrawal:** If a state is not willing to continue (there is a general understanding that the state should withdraw (BREXIT) [cite: 10]
