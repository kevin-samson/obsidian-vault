# UNCLOS and Law of the Sea

  

* Law of the Sea evolved through state practices (Customary International Law) into formal laws.

* There have been 3 UN Conventions on the Law of the Sea.

* The most recent one (1982) came into effect in 1994[cite: 9].

* The 1982 Convention, signed by over 150 states, is the main legal framework for regulating all ocean space[cite: 9, 10].

* It covers:

    * Offshore limits of national jurisdiction

    * Access to the seas

    * Navigation

    * Marine environment protection

    * Living resource exploitation/conservation

    * Non-living resource exploitation

    * Seabed mining

    * Scientific research [cite: 10]

* The 1982 convention divides the sea and airspace above it into different zones[cite: 9].

  

##   Sea Zones Under UNCLOS

  

* **Territorial Sea:**

    * Extends up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline[cite: 11, 12].

    * Coastal state has sovereignty here (like over its land)[cite: 12].

    * Foreign vessels have the right of innocent passage[cite: 12].

    * Coastal state has sovereignty over the airspace above it[cite: 13, 14].

* **Contiguous Zone:**

    * Extends 12 nautical miles beyond the territorial sea[cite: 14, 15].

    * Coastal state can control customs, immigration, and quarantine here[cite: 15].

* **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ):**

    * Extends up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline[cite: 16, 17].

    * Coastal state has sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing natural resources (living and non-living) in the water, seabed, and subsoil[cite: 17].

    * Coastal state does *not* have full sovereignty here[cite: 18].

* **Continental Shelf:**

    * Extends beyond the territorial sea to 200 nautical miles from the baseline, or further to the outer edge of the continental margin (as defined in UNCLOS Article 76)[cite: 1].

    * Coastal state has sovereign rights to explore and exploit mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil[cite: 2].

* **High Seas:**

    * Area beyond national jurisdiction[cite: 3].

    * All states have freedom of navigation and overflight[cite: 3].

    * States can lay cables and pipelines here[cite: 4].

* **The Area:**

    * Seabed and subsoil beyond national jurisdiction[cite: 5, 6].

    * Its non-living mineral resources are the "common heritage of mankind"[cite: 6].

    * Managed by the International Seabed Authority (established under UNCLOS)[cite: 6].

  

##   Importance of Islands Under UNCLOS

  

* Islands can significantly increase a country's EEZ area[cite: 7].

* More islands = more EEZ area[cite: 7, 8].

* This is why countries don't give up sovereignty over islands and contest ownership[cite: 8].
