# Introduction
- Animation is an illusion or perception of motion
- Works by playing a series of images fast enough to trick our minds into believing that there is movement
- Great way to increase appeal of multimedia applications
- Can be used to simplify complex concepts 
- They can be simple, 2D, 3D etc.

## Animation Guidelines
  

- Use animation to highlight important content; it should enhance the user experience, not distract.  

- Match the animation to the application's mood and content to keep it relevant.  

- Limit the number of animations per page to avoid overwhelming users.  

- Avoid repetitive animations, as they can become annoying.  

- Use smooth transitions and effects to help communicate your message.  

- Ensure animations load quickly to prevent user frustration.  

- Use animation when video is impractical, especially for depicting motion.  

- Use animation for tiny details where video might lack clarity.  

- Video often has lower resolution than animation, making animation preferable in some cases.  

A well-designed animation should be meaningful, smooth, and purposeful.

# Animation Rates: Sampling Rate vs. Playback Rate

- **Sampling rate**: The number of images created per second for animation.  
- **Playback rate**: The number of frames shown per second when watching the animation.  
- The **playback rate cannot be higher** than the sampling rate.  

## Recommended Playback Rates:
- **Full-motion video**: 24–30 frames per second (fps) for smooth motion.  
- **Web animation**: Typically 12–15 fps.  
- **Below 12 fps**: Motion appears jerky as the eye notices each frame change.  

For smooth animation, ensure the playback rate is high enough to maintain fluid motion.

# Types of Animation

## Cel Animation
- Images are drawn on **clear sheets** called celluloid.  
- These images are placed over a **fixed background**.  
- The **background stays the same**, while the moving objects change from frame to frame.

## Frame Based Animation
- Animation is created by making **changes from one frame to the next**.  
- **Keyframes** are important frames that show major changes in the animation.  
- Changes between keyframes can include **position, color, shape, or other properties**.  

### Tweening
- **Tweening** is the process of generating frames between two keyframes.  
- It helps create **smooth transitions** between movements.  
- At least **two keyframes** are needed for tweening to work.  

## Path-based Animation
- Also called **vector animation**, where an object moves along a path.  
- The object follows a **line or vector** to create movement.  
- **Only one object and a path** are needed to start the animation.  
- **Tweening** is used to fill in the frames, making the movement smooth.

# Animation Techniques  

  

### Morphing  
- **Blends two images** into a smooth transition.  
- Uses multiple frames to create the illusion of **one object transforming into another**.  
- In Adobe Flash, simple vector morphing is done using **shape tweening**.  

### Warping  

- **Distorts a single image** to create an effect.  

- Unlike morphing, **only one image** is involved.  

  

### Film Loop  

- A **series of animated frames** that **repeats continuously**.  

  

### Trail Effect  

- The image from the **previous frame is not fully erased**, creating a motion blur effect.
