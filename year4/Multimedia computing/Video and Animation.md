# Introduction
- Animation is an illusion or perception of motion
- Works by playing a series of images fast enough to trick our minds into believing that there is movement
- Great way to increase appeal of multimedia applications
- Can be used to simplify complex concepts 
- They can be simple, 2D, 3D etc.

## Animation Guidelines
  

- Use animation to highlight important content; it should enhance the user experience, not distract.  

- Match the animation to the application's mood and content to keep it relevant.  

- Limit the number of animations per page to avoid overwhelming users.  

- Avoid repetitive animations, as they can become annoying.  

- Use smooth transitions and effects to help communicate your message.  

- Ensure animations load quickly to prevent user frustration.  

- Use animation when video is impractical, especially for depicting motion.  

- Use animation for tiny details where video might lack clarity.  

- Video often has lower resolution than animation, making animation preferable in some cases.  

A well-designed animation should be meaningful, smooth, and purposeful.

# Animation Rates: Sampling Rate vs. Playback Rate

- **Sampling rate**: The number of images created per second for animation.  
- **Playback rate**: The number of frames shown per second when watching the animation.  
- The **playback rate cannot be higher** than the sampling rate.  

## Recommended Playback Rates:
- **Full-motion video**: 24–30 frames per second (fps) for smooth motion.  
- **Web animation**: Typically 12–15 fps.  
- **Below 12 fps**: Motion appears jerky as the eye notices each frame change.  

For smooth animation, ensure the playback rate is high enough to maintain fluid motion.
